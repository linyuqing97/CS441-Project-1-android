# CS441-Project-1-android
This is my first project on Anroid Studio.

Objective:
This project will ask users to input their name first. Than it will ask users' universities, if the user from Binghamton univerisy it will out put "Hey Bucats, let's say hello to the world" with a bearcat image, otherwise, it will just promopt "Hello World from the user".Sinee I stay on campus this summer, why not using bearcat?

This project has three activity pages.
    The first page will ask user's name,with a Plain text prompt.Then, a submit button which creates a intent and put uses's name imformation to the second and thrid pages with a key.
    The second page will prompt a quesion asking users to choice weather they are Binghamton university or no.  A textview is here to display quesion with user's name imformation gather from the first page. This page also has a set of yes and no button which triger the third page with two diffrent intext, yes and no intent. 
    On the thirdpage, a textview would ouput hello world with tow different version which depends on uses' choices. A bearcat image will only display if users from Binghamton Univeristy.
